# Labs

This folder stores the weekly labs that were completed to fulfill the requirements of CPP 528 Fall 2021.

## Instructions

Each weekly folder contains the lab requirement for that particular week. All labs reference the [`source_file_rn.R`](analysis/source_file_rn.R) script, which contains the data intake, processing, and transformation steps. The script also includes functions to explore the datasets.
