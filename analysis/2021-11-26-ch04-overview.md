**New Market Tax Credits (NMTC)**
The NMTC program provides a federal tax credit to investors utilizing private investment capital to develop in economically distressed communities. To qualify for the tax credit, investments must meet specified criteria and qualifications. Most investments are made in "Low-Income Communities", which have either a poverty rate of 20 percent or greater, or a median family income at or below 80 percent of the applicable area median family income.

For more information, visit the [NMTC program website](https://www.cdfifund.gov/programs-training/programs/new-markets-tax-credit).

**Low Income Housing Tax Credits (LIHTC)**

The LIHTC supports affordable housing creation in the United States by giving state and local agencies an annual budget to issue tax credits. The tax credits may be used for the rehabilitation of existing affordable housing or building new rental housing targets towards lower-income households.
