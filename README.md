# CPP 528 Template

Template GitHub repo for CPP 528.

## Context

The [`index.html`](index.html) file serves a purpose which is to ensure that the `README.md` file does not get displayed back to the user on the home page of the website.

## About page

The [about page](about.md) is a markdown file that relies on a data stored within the YAML header to populate photos, a brief bio, and hyperlinked icons about each team member. 

```yaml
---
title: About
subtitle: The humans behind this project
team:
  - name: Romi and Phoebe
    img: ../assets/img/about/romi_and_phoebe.jpg
    desc: Two excellent rescue hounds who bring much joy to our family.

As your team grows, be sure to update this file accordingly, specifically the `team` sub-section.

## Potential problems

Some Mac user may experience problems building their website using this custom Jekyll theme. The following steps are needed to overcome this problem:

1. Download the Ruby 2.7 version via [homebrew](https://brew.sh/)

```bash
brew install ruby@2.7
```

2. Download the Jekyll bundler which contains the "remote" theme

```bash
sudo gem install jekyll bundler
```
