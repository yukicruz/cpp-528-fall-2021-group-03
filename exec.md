## Executive Summary

In this project, we are interested in building models to explain neighborhood change between 1990 and 2010. To accomplish this, census data from the Longitudinal Tracts Data Base was analyzed. Two models were made to determine if the New Market Tax Credit (NMTC) program or  Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) program resulted in the greatest neighborhood improvement. The impact of the poverty rate, percent unemployment, and percent professional variables was evaluated in relation to both models. In both programs, the variable evaluating the growth rate of the treatment group above the control growth rate was found to be significant. The NMTC program had a larger, significant growth rate in comparison to the LIHTC program when both the no control variable and the poverty rate control were examined. It was found that the poverty rate was a good predictor of Median House Value growth as the variable value was closest to that of the no control variable model for both programs.
